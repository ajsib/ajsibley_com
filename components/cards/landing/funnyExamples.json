They say that it's like a drug and that they crave it at all hours of the night. While there's no evidence to support this claim, it's still a popular theory among Pizza-Pizza fans. So next time you're craving a slice at 2am, just remember that it might not be your fault!"

You'll hear the same Drake song for the 100th time in one night, and you'll see girls with dyed hair and too much makeup grinding on the dance floor. It's not for everyone, but if you're looking for a wild night out, Stages is the place to be. Just don't say we didn't warn you!"
